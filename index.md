# Welcome to my ePortfolio

I update this page using this [this link.](https://github.com/masonvoorhees/ePortfolio/edit/gh-pages/index.md)
This ePortfolio contains work from previous classes that I have improved on in order to showcase the skills I have obtained while studying at SNHU.


## Code Review

This code review will go over two artifacts I have chosen from previous courses. I will outline the flaws and enhancements that will be made to these artifacts.

## Artifacts (before enhancements)

### Databases
For this artifact enhancement, I will use an old assignment from CS340 using python and MongoDB which accesses information stored regarding an animal shelter. I will enhance this project by creating more refined tools to run queries on the database. Right now, this project only has predefined CRUD functionality in the python code. This means in order for me to CRUD anything, I need to go into my python code and change the hard-coded values. I will be creating a way for the user to choose if they want to create, read, update, or delete something and write to the database in real-time. This will make my database work with the python project in a more standalone fashion. I will also add more data that can be entered into my database. Right now, my database takes two fields, an animal species, and an animal name. I will be adding more fields such as age, gender, color, and weight. I will also refine this application to meet coding standards along beautifying the user interface.

Here are two links in order to access the files for this project:

### Software Design / Engineering 
For this artifact enhancement, I will be improving on a project I worked on in CS310 where I created an object with a playlist that had strings for each song in a playlist. I will be improving on this application by making the object I created more detailed and even  implementing a link that will redirect to YouTube to play songs in each playlist. I will use coding standards to comment what each function and line of code does for future use. When I first started programming, I never really documented what all my code did. After that, I will be showcasing my skills in creating objects. I will create new objects that will work with the playlists. I will call these albums. I will create an album that contains a list of songs by a certain artist. I will then modify the playlist object to take that new album object I created. This will mean the playlist object will no longer contain the object of a song but instead an object of an album. I never completed this project fully either so I will be completing this project to its full extent.

### Algorithms and Data Structures 
For Algorithms and data structures I will be using the same project I used in CS310. I will be improving on the overall function of the application by incorporating arrays, linked lists, and functions to better sort my data. Right now, the assignment simply prints a list of songs in the console, I will be making this application far more of a standalone experience where YouTube will launch and play the selected song. By completing these tasks, I will showcase my skills in algorithms and data structures.
